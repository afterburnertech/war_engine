# Why is this require here?
# We could put the require for Warden within the
# file at lib/war_engine.rb, but due to how the 
# engine is loaded by Rake tasks, that file is not
# required at all. This means that any require 
# statements within that file would not be executed.
# Placing it within lib/war_engine/engine.rb will
# make it work for our test purposes, when we use 
# the engine inside an application, and when we 
# want to run Rake tasks on the engine itself.
